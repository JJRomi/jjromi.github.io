## Day of the Programmer (Hacker Rank)
Marie invented a Time Machine and wants to test it by time-traveling to visit Russia on the Day of the Programmer (the day of the year) during a year in the inclusive range from to .

From to , Russia's official calendar was the Julian calendar; since they used the Gregorian calendar system. The transition from the Julian to Gregorian calendar system occurred in , when the next day after January was February . This means that in , February was the day of the year in Russia.

In both calendar systems, February is the only month with a variable amount of days; it has days during a leap year, and days during all other years. In the Julian calendar, leap years are divisible by ; in the Gregorian calendar, leap years are either of the following:

Divisible by . Divisible by and not divisible by . Given a year, , find the date of the day of that year according to the official Russian calendar during that year. Then print it in the format dd.mm.yyyy, where dd is the two-digit day, mm is the two-digit month, and yyyy is .
