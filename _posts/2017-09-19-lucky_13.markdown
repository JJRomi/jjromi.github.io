## Breaking the Records (Hacker Rank)
Maria plays  games of college basketball in a season. Because she wants to go pro, she tracks her points scored per game sequentially in an array defined as . After each game , she checks to see if score  breaks her record for most or least points scored so far during that season.

Given Maria's array of  for a season of  games, find and print the number of times she breaks her record for most and least points scored during the season.

Note: Assume her records for most and least points at the start of the season are the number of points scored during the first game of the season.

public class Solution {

    static int[] getRecord(int[] s){
        int min =  s[0], max = s[0];
        int[] change = new int[2];
        for (Integer val : s){
            if(max < val){
                max = val;
                change[0]++;
            }else if(min > val){
                min = val;
                change[1]++;
            }
        }

        return change;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = in.nextInt();
        int[] s = new int[n];
        for(int s_i=0; s_i < n; s_i++){
            s[s_i] = in.nextInt();
        }
        int[] result = getRecord(s);
        String separator = "", delimiter = " ";
        for (Integer val : result) {
            System.out.print(separator + val);
            separator = delimiter;
        }
        System.out.println("");
    }
