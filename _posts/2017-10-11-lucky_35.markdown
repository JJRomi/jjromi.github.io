## Weighted Uniform Strings (Hacker Rank)
A weighted string is a string of lowercase English letters where each letter has a weight in the inclusive range from  to , defined below:

We define the following terms:

The weight of a string is the sum of the weights of all the string's characters. For example:

A uniform string is a string consisting of a single character repeated zero or more times. For example, ccc and a are uniform strings, but bcb and cd are not (i.e., they consist of more than one distinct character).
Given a string, , let  be the set of weights for all possible uniform substrings (contiguous) of string . You have to answer  queries, where each query  consists of a single integer, . For each query, print Yes on a new line if ; otherwise, print No instead.

Note: The  symbol denotes that  is an element of set .
