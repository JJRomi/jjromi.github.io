## Between Two Sets
Consider two sets of positive integers,  and . We say that a positive integer, , is between sets  and  if the following conditions are satisfied:

All elements in  are factors of .
 is a factor of all elements in .
In other words, some  is between  and  if that value of  satisfies  for every  in  and also satisfies  for every  in . For example, if  and , then our possible  values are and .

Given  and , find and print the number of integers (i.e., possible 's) that are between the two sets.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of  (the number of elements in set ) and  (the number of elements in set ).
The second line contains  distinct space-separated integers describing .
The third line contains  distinct space-separated integers describing .

        n = list(filter(lambda x: (i%x) == 0, a))
        m = list(filter(lambda y: (y%i) == 0, b))
        if len(n) == len(a) and len(m) == len(b):
           result += 1
    return result     

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n, m = input().strip().split(' ')
    n, m = [int(n), int(m)]
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split(' ')))
    b = list(map(int, input().strip().split(' ')))
