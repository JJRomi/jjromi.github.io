## Drawing Book (Hacker Rank)
Brie’s Drawing teacher asks her class to open their -page book to page number . Brie can either start turning pages from the front of the book (i.e., page number ) or from the back of the book (i.e., page number ), and she always turns pages one-by-one (as opposed to skipping through multiple pages at once). When she opens the book, page  is always on the right side:

Each page in the book has two sides, front and back, except for the last page which may only have a front side depending on the total number of pages of the book (see the Explanation sections below for additional diagrams).

Given  and , find and print the minimum number of pages Brie must turn in order to arrive at page .

```
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.text.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.util.regex.*;

public class Solution {

    static int solve(int n, int p){
        // Brie start turning from page 1
        int min = p/2;
        // Brie start turning from page n
        int n_start = (n/2) - (p/2);
        if(n_start < min){
           min = n_start;
        }
        return min;
    }



    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = in.nextInt();
        int p = in.nextInt();
        int result = solve(n, p);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
