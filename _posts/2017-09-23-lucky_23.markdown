## Electronics Shop (Hacker Rank)
Monica wants to buy exactly one keyboard and one USB drive from her favorite electronics store. The store sells  different brands of keyboards and  different brands of USB drives. Monica has exactly  dollars to spend, and she wants to spend as much of it as possible (i.e., the total cost of her purchase must be maximal).

Given the price lists for the store's keyboards and USB drives, find and print the amount money Monica will spend. If she doesn't have enough money to buy one keyboard and one USB drive, print -1 instead.

Note: She will never buy more than one keyboard and one USB drive even if she has the leftover money to do so.

public class Solution {

    static int getMoneySpent(int[] keyboards, int[] drives, int s){
        int max = -1;
        int amount = 0;
        for(Integer keyboard:keyboards){
            for(Integer drive:drives){
                amount = keyboard + drive;
                if(s >= amount && max < amount){
                    max = amount;
                }
            }
        }

        return max;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int s = in.nextInt();
        int n = in.nextInt();
        int m = in.nextInt();
        int[] keyboards = new int[n];
        for(int keyboards_i=0; keyboards_i < n; keyboards_i++){
            keyboards[keyboards_i] = in.nextInt();
        }
        int[] drives = new int[m];
        for(int drives_i=0; drives_i < m; drives_i++){
            drives[drives_i] = in.nextInt();
        }
        //  The maximum amount of money she can spend on a keyboard and USB drive, or -1 if she can't purchase both items
        int moneySpent = getMoneySpent(keyboards, drives, s);
        System.out.println(moneySpent);
    }
}
