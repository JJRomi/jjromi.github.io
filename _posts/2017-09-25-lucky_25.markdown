## The Hurdle Race
Dan is playing a video game in which his character competes in a hurdle race by jumping over  hurdles with heights . He can initially jump a maximum height of  units, but he has an unlimited supply of magic beverages that help him jump higher! Each time Dan drinks a magic beverage, the maximum height he can jump during the race increases by  unit.

Given , , and the heights of all the hurdles, find and print the minimum number of magic beverages Dan must drink to complete the race.
