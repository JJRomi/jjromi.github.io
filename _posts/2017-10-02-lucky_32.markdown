## Game of Stones (Hacker Rank)
Two players (numbered  and ) are playing a game with  stones. Player  always plays first, and the two players move in alternating turns. The game's rules are as follows:

In a single move, a player can remove either , , or  stones from the game board.
If a player is unable to make a move, that player loses the game.
Given the number of stones, find and print the name of the winner (i.e.,  or ) on a new line. Each player plays optimally, meaning they will not make a move that causes them to lose the game if some better, winning move exists.
