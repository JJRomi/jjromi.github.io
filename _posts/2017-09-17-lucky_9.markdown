## Grading Students (Hacker Rank)
HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

Every student receives a  in the inclusive range from  to .
Any  less than  is a failing grade.
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's  according to these rules:

If the difference between the  and the next multiple of  is less than , round  up to the next multiple of .
If the value of  is less than , no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
For example,  will be rounded to  but  will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than .

Given the initial value of  for each of Sam's  students, write code to automate the rounding process. For each , round it according to the rules above and print the result on a new line.

```
#!/bin/python3

import sys

def solve(grades):
    result = []
    for grade in grades:
        next = grade if grade % 5 == 0 else grade - (grade%5) + 5
        if grade < 38:
            result.append(grade)
        elif next - grade < 3:
            result.append(next)
        else:
            result.append(grade)
    return result
    # Complete this function

n = int(input().strip())
grades = []
grades_i = 0
for grades_i in range(n):
   grades_t = int(input().strip())
   grades.append(grades_t)
result = solve(grades)
print ("\n".join(map(str, result)))
