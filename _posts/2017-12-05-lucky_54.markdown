## Marc's Cakewalk (Hacker Rank)
Marc loves cupcakes, but he also likes to stay fit. He eats  cupcakes in one sitting, and each cupcake  has a calorie count, . After eating a cupcake with  calories, he must walk at least  (where  is the number cupcakes he has already eaten) miles to maintain his weight.

Given the individual calorie counts for each of the  cupcakes, find and print a long integer denoting the minimum number of miles Marc must walk to maintain his weight. Note that he can eat the cupcakes in any order.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = in.nextInt();
        int[] calories = new int[n];
        for(int calories_i=0; calories_i < n; calories_i++){
            calories[calories_i] = in.nextInt();
        }
        Arrays.sort(calories);
        long sum = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
          //  System.out.println("sum : " + calories[n-i-1] + ": " + (i));
              sum += (calories[n-i-1] * Math.pow(2,i));
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
